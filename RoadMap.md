# TheSky Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Mechanics & Foundation (Initial Setup)
- [ ] **Project Initialization**: Set up the basic file structure (`index.html`, `style.css`, `game.js`).
- [ ] **Basic Rendering Engine**: Implement a simple rendering loop using HTML5 Canvas.
- [ ] **Player Control**: Implement the crystal's basic rightward movement.
- [ ] **Acceleration Mechanic**: Implement the 'D' key and 'Space' key hold-to-accelerate feature.
- [ ] **Scene Management**: Create a system to manage and transition between different visual themes.

## Phase 2: Visual Spectacle & Environments
- [ ] **Implement Core Themes**:
    - [ ] Spring (Grasslands, petals)
    - [ ] Summer (Bright sun, vibrant colors)
    - [ ] Autumn (Wind, falling leaves)
    - [ ] Winter (Snowfields, snowfall)
    - [ ] Starry Sky (Galaxy, stars)
- [ ] **Parallax Scrolling**: Implement multi-layered backgrounds for a sense of depth.
- [ ] **Particle System**: Create effects for weather (rain, snow), atmosphere (dust, pollen), and player actions (trailing effects).
- [ ] **Procedural Generation**: Begin exploring procedural generation for terrain and prop placement to create endless unique landscapes.

## Phase 3: Gameplay Polish & User Experience
- [ ] **UI/HUD**: Design and implement a minimal user interface (e.g., scene titles, user guides).
- [ ] **Cinematic Effects**: Add post-processing effects like bloom, vignettes, and film grain to enhance the visual mood.
- [ ] **Sound Design**: Integrate background music and sound effects that complement the serene and epic visual themes (Optional).
- [ ] **Refine Controls**: Fine-tune the player's movement and acceleration to feel fluid and responsive.

## Phase 4: Optimization & Expansion
- [ ] **Performance Tuning**: Optimize rendering and game logic to ensure smooth performance across devices.
- [ ] **WASM Integration (Optional)**: Explore using C++ and WebAssembly for performance-critical parts of the rendering pipeline if needed.
- [ ] **Expand Scene Library**: Add more unique, built-in scenes (deserts, oceans, villages, etc.).
- [ ] **Enhance Procedural Generation**: Improve the variety and complexity of procedurally generated worlds.
